# Linux-Bash-Malwares

This is a Software that I have programmed for the study of a series of viruses (Just for linux).

The tool has a graphical interface that is very simple to use in which you only have to select the virus you want and it will automatically make it for you.

The tool in the comments and the names of the viruses is in English so if you don't have much idea what it says please translate it otherwise you will have difficulties using the program.

Next, the tool has a total of 7 viruses, each of which has a certain type of range in terms of dangerousness when handling your computer.

(That are writed in Bash).

(Bash its a Scripting language of family of programing languages based on unix commands so this virus just have effect in linux OS dont try it in others please)-

The order is Annoying >> Dangerous >> and Deadly.

If you have issues tell me what problems you have and i help you.

Finally, I am NOT responsible for what you do with these Malwares, the use of the tool is your decision...
